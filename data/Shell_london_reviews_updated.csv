The machines got stuck half way through, called the number on the receipt, the cashier could not understand what ""the car wash stopped half way through"" means. Sat in the car for another few minutes, when realised nobody's planning to come, reversed out and went to the cashier. He was happily chatting to other customers. When I reiterated the problem, he looked at me like I was an alien, still not understanding what I was saying. I said straight to him - I want a refund. He looked at the receipt for good 2 minutes clearly not having any idea what to do with it. Eventually have cash refund (paid with a credit card, so the end of day accounts won't make sense to the company). Now I understand that on a bank holiday weekend normal employees are off, but come on... That's a massive health and safety issue. What if we were stuck under the machine??",2016-08-28T12:51:24.171Z

Car was as described and is spot on condition wise. I would recommend  this dealer, so if you want a replacement car go to Lavender Hill, chat to Heath and I'm sure he will sort you out a good deal. You can of course buy cheaper privately ( but not always ), but there is more risk for the buyer. Having been in the motor industry for over 35 years I think I know a good car when I see one and I tend to use small dealers - they need to sell cars and therefore do not put some over inflated value on their stock, as can happen and does happen on a privately advertised ones , with no come back for you should there be major issues. But I don't think that would happen at Lavender Hill !

I asked for it back as had my petrol on it as well as car wash but he refused. After politely advising him it was my receipt he would not budge & kept telling me to go as he had given me a refund so what else did I want. Incredibly rude young man telling me to be quiet & go!

NEVER EVER just take a lottery ticket to this petrol station to get it checked!!! I'd scanned my ticket this morning and knew I'd won ¬£25 and a lucky dip, this afternoon I went to wash my car there and thought I'd collect my winnings. There were two men serving at the till I handed my ticket over and never said how much I'd won they started talking in their own language then the man serving me said I'd won a lucky dip and asked if I wanted it for Wed or Sat. I said it's not just a lucky dip though is it! He said yes it is and I said no I've scanned it I have won ¬£25 and a lucky dip. I said I want my ticket back he handed it back to me and the two men looked at each other. The other thing that made me think something was odd was usually if you win something even a lucky dip the machine will give a little fanfare there was no sound at all ....I wonder how many people have just taken their word for it and thought they'd won nothing!

I used to go here, but often want a sandwich at the same time as buying fuel and they have ruined theirs.
They have a new range by Jamie Oliver that are far from pleasurable to eat. I did not check the nutritional information, but would guess that it is a more healthy range, because I can't fathom any other reason for bringing out a range so lacking in taste.
I had a bacon and eggs sandwich, only to find a tasteless sandwich lacking enough filling and flavor, and containing leaves. Leaves in a bacon and egg sandwich and certainly didn't make up for the lack of flavour.
I then forgot and went to shell again to get my lunch. I bought a BLT because I thought that would be a safe but it was pitiful and tasteless.
I have nothing against offering a famous chef's special taste free range, but there needs to be a choice.
To my mind garage food is their for convenience to save time by not having to go one place for petrol and another to get lunch, but I can no longer do this at shell without having a miserable lunch indeed.
It is a shame because everything else was very convenient. They have a free cash point, hot coffee, and an Amazon prime collection point, but without edible sandwiches I will go somewhere else.",2019-05-17T03:46:08.355Z

With that, I told him "" Your right, you can put these back on the shelf and you've just lost a sale. I'll get them from the shop across the road where they will not give me a lecture about what I can or cannot have and it will be much cheaper"".

I would seriously review the App team at Shell HQ. I have tried being loyal to Shell to use the App, but the app is a shambles. For starters there is a new App out every 3-6 months, which then causes you to lose your total trip amount.

Secondly and most annoyingly, after 10 trips Shell is meant to reward you, annoyingly,  my trips are not calculated properly and when I am getting close to the 10 trips, it goes back down to saying you have done 4 trips, 6 more to go!!! Even though I can back up the number of trips I have made as it's all linked to my PayPal account.

Very shoddy work by the App team, its about time you really looked at this as its actually a nice and convenient proposition.

Flabbergasted as to why he couldn‚Äôt have politely answered that yes the canister was full and shown me the reader to put my kind at rest.
He then 5 minutes later decided to become sarcastic stating that in ‚Äú30 years of doing his job nobody had asked him that question before.
I am not surprised that I have heard such terrible reviews of the arrogance and rude behaviour of this manager and his staff from friends previously.

Shell Apex Corner Barnet Wy London NW7 3ET,3.1,Natalie London,1,"Arrived to collect item from amazon locker which is listed as on the forecourt. Searched the forecourt, no locker. Showed the guy the amazon email through the window, he shook his head and mouthed nothing to do with me. Told me to go in the store. He was not wearing a mask so I decided against that. So I phoned the store and explained, asked where the locker was, he didn‚Äôt tell me and hung up. As I went to drive away without my item I noticed the locked is attached to the back of the building.

What a jobsworth attitude. Amazon pay for the use of the garages space, he could have just said drive round the back. Manners are free.

I recall now when I first moved to this area using that petrol station once and thinking never again due to rude bad service. Can‚Äôt recall if it was the same guy but obviously the ethos has not changed. If you drive 1.5 miles up the A1 towards Borehamwood there is a much cheaper Shell garage with friendly helpful staff.

Shell London Rd Virginia Water GU25 4QF,3.1,Dana,5,"I visit this station most weekends as I start my walk in Virginia Water and I get a Costa coffee from the machine. I don't interact much other than Good Morning and paying but I have noticed that the staff are very safety oriented - in my book this is excellent.

On one ocassion they refused an existing supplier to deliver some materials which were not compliant. The second time, today actually, they challenged me for taking a video. I had no evil intention just wanted to show a friend who lives abroad.

We had a chat and he was very polite but firm.

I like that.

Customer service is not always about being subservient and extra nice ..it is also about keeping us safe and this Shell station does a great job at that.

In few occasions at least two pumps were not in use and the access to pump 8 and 4 blocked by a car, I hope didn't belong to staff. Some of the sale-persons will offer you what you are entitled to according to the company promotions, such as promo code cards, money back, etc. The others, especially during the day shift, will not mention a word even you use the app (obviously all the details about any promotion is there, on your account). I truly believe that what you suppose to get, one pound, a treat or a code for a spin should be offered straight away by sales-person. If you forget to ask the second option is to contact customer service. God forbid to find there, like I did, an agent that probably skipped the training because his line manager was too busy being manager and make you feel like a beggar. ""Please be informed that you should claim the game card on site during the transaction. This code which you have received is a one-time gesture of good will"" and sending you in the same email the promotion's T&C. There you will find two contradictory paragraphs; one mentioning about promo codes based on availability for everyone and the other will offer all the time a code for those who will pay-at-pump. I tend to believe 90% of the customers do not read T&C as long as they get a very clear message on the app as per photo attached. Guess what, when I mentioned in my complaint that I am expecting a response from a manager, the agent said: ""Unfortunately, It is not possible to discuss this matter with my manager."" I am wondering which is the professional level of the managers at least in London in a such a big and well known company. Customer service = zero.

Shell Grosvenor Rd Pimlico London SW1V 3JY,2.8,O Ba,3,"The Filling Station

A small filling station with a maximum capacity of about four cars at once. So it's advisable to take a quick glance at the station to see if it's full of cars before turning into it, or else you will find yourself blocking the main road.

The Fuel Types

They have both petrol and diesel obviously but there are two types of unleaded; the normal unleaded and another type with a higher percentage of octane.

In a nutshell, higher octane just prevents your vehicle engine from premature combustion. In other words, it prevents your vehicle engine from knocking. Hope that helps.

Tire Pressure and Water

The position of the water and tire pressure machine is located at the front, on the left and inline with the filling of fuel.

You can fill petrol or diesel in your vehicle and then move forward to gauge your tire pressure by paying a minimum of 50 pence for 4 minutes and you can just pay with your phone using GPay or with your contactless card...easy peasy! Note that it also takes 10 and 20 pence, and 1 pound coin.

Note that your hands will get dirty if you pull the hose with your bear hand. I did this and my hands got dirty and just water may not clean it because it's kind of black and oily. So I went into the store to look for something I can use to wipe my hands but couldn't find any.

Filling the Fuel

Fill your fuel safely. I like to keep an eye on both the fuel price and the amount of fuel while some people may keep an eye on the fuel litres or just the fuel price. Whichever one is preferrable to you, the most important is to keep an eye on one or both of them while filling your vehicle fuel tank to prevent spending more than you can afford.

Paying for Fuel

The convenience store (just at the front which your car should be facing) where you pay for fuel, is very tight inside with little space for 2 persons to queue and pay.",2022-07-06T20:24:05.607Z

Instore was also very clean and tidy, with a pleasant retail environment and a good selection of hot and cold food.  The pies, pasties, etc looked very good and were well presented.

There were two cashiers in the kiosk.  The customer service was friendly and efficient. Having decided to buy a Stilton pie, I was pleasantly surprised to be told that as it had gone 5.00 pm it would only be ¬£1 (rather than ¬£3.50) as they like to ensure food isn‚Äôt wasted at the end of the day - a really good initiative!

OH MY GOOODDDD!!! 30-40 min ago I went to this petrol station to put some fuel in my partner's car and buy her a phone holder. 2 separate cars. I looked after parking spaces and I parked in front of the store, it looked like the right place, as all the other ones had electric charging points. So my car parked in front of store, my partner at the pump. It was just a window service so we asked the lad to show us a phone holder. He seems a bit rude from that point but never mint. It was long day for us so we did not bother.  After that I went with my partner's car to fit the phone holder in her car so she can drive away. I think I spent 4-6 min inside. When I waled back to my car....oh my god.... say ohh my god. The petrol staition employee was moaning and hitting my car , my mirrors apparently because I parked in the wrong spot. I said, why are you hitting my car? he was keep moaning and went
around my car and hit the other mirror right in front of me!! I couldn't believe my eyes. OH MY GOD!!  Shocking!! name on the badge was Johnnson if I remeber corectly . 22.30pm on 15.11.2022. I will try to get an email for an official complaint . My mirros now they don't look to act the same . and they both are a bit wobbly. I had a long day.... I preferred to jump in my car and drive away....but OHH MY GOODDD. I ve done nothing. Even if I had parked my car in a bad spot....there was almost no one in the petrol station, I was there, there was no need for that!!! avoid that petrol station!!! I will look for an oficial complaint and need to have my mirrors checked.

This morning on my way to my son's school drop off, I pulled into the garage as my tyre low pressure warning was on. When I tried to fill the tyre, it became clear that the tyre was bust, and that I needed to put a replacement on.

Suresh doesn't know me at all, but out of pure human kindness, and without me asking, and without him asking anything from me,  gave me his car so that I could take my son to school. When I offered him my car keys as ""security"" that I would bring his car back, he was confused by the offer and dismissed it as unnecessary. I am honestly blown away by the kindness and compassion he showed me.

Then when I returned to the garage after dropping my son at school, Javeed, without being asked, and without asking anything in return, helped me in replacing the wheel. Offering me cardboard such that I wouldn't get my clothes dirty. Offering me additional tools when the bolts wouldn't come unstuck. And black bagging the damaged tyre such that it wouldn't dirty my car when I put the tyre back into the car.

Shell 112-122 Gipsy Hill London SE19 1PL,3.8,Kwesi Assabere,1,"So, on the 21.02.2023 at 11:28:09am I purchased diesel fuel from this station. So, as I started to fuel my vehicle, the pump stopped fuelling at 15:00 GBP which had been stopped from the shop attendant and then I was asked to come into the shop. When inside the shop, the attendant tells me that my vehicle registration is not valid and hence the reason why she stopped the pump. She stated that she checked the registration number and that it is not valid. Bear in mind, that I had picked up an ""End of Lease vehicle"" from a customer and I had in full view my ""Trade Plates"" in full view - front & back as per road traffic regulations. Furthermore, a full check had been done on the vehicle before attending to the customer. The attendant who was a trainee, an Asian female, was feeling the need to practice her racisim on me, I asked for her name and she told me point blank she will not give me her name or the name  of her manager and that I wait for her manager who will come onsite after 12:00 noon. The only badge on her person was a ""Trainee"" badge and furthermore she was the only person on site. After back and forth arguing, she told me to go back to the pump and continue to refuel, with my blood boiling with rage. After refuelling, I went back to the shop to pay with my Euroshell card for the amount of 25.82 GBP. She also stated that she had been trained to racial profile black males and check their vehicles. The disrespect and the racial profiling at this station begars believeth. The receipt - Terminal number ID 05092501. So, is this the type of training Shell is giving to it's trainees, is it?

I was beyond shocked! Obviously he was making sure I wouldn't reuse the discount again at his station or another again by me rescanning the same barcode. Does he REALLY believe Shell's loyalty system works that primitively by the discount just being stored on the screen's barcode?! I hope not! I myself work in the IT/payment systems industry and am very confident it doesn't work that way! Never had anyone or any company told me what I must do on my OWN phone!

Shell 154 Watford Rd Wembley HA0 3HB,3.5,Clarke Inverary,1,"I came here last week to fill my car with my partner, I always have a problem with the staff here, but don't say anything because they weren't blatant with their prejudiced behaviour before the other day, only displaying small micro aggressions when I go into the station to pay.

I'm extremely polite as I work in the customer service industry and believe all frontline workers should be treated with respect, while they are on the Job, but I believe this respect should be expressed both ways by workers and customers, however on this occasion I don't feel like this was honoured and the line of respect was crossed this time by them unfortunately leading to this negative review.

What lead up to this was while I was at shell I asked my partner to pop into tesco to buy some food for lunch so I gave her my bank card to pay for it while i was filling up my tank, and while i was doing so the petrol station attendant was looking a me very hard like just committed a crime, so . looked at him back and smiled assuring him every is Ok.

by this point i had finished filling up my car with petrol however i couldn't pay immediately as my partner was still in Tesco purchasing the food with my debit card so, so I put the petrol pump back in the holster and waited till she finished, however the petrol station cashier came out from behind the till and out of the shop and started giving me dirty looks which made me feel extremely uncomfortable as it's unprofessional behaviour to treat a customer with this level of open hostility, so I look him back and
""asked is everything okay sir"" which he didn't reply.

Suddenly a few moments later my partner comes out of Tesco and starts walking over to the oetrol station to hand e my bank card so I could pay for the petrol, and as I turn towards her he goes back inside the shop and behind the till.

My partner was only gone for two minutes and in that time the cashier thinks its acceptable behaviour to racially profile me assuming I'm not going to pay because I didn't do so immediately, but isn't professional enough to allow for a grace period of two minutes when the petrol station was completely empty, and when I go into pay now that I have my card doesn't even attempt to apologise for how uncomfortable he made me feel with his aggressive behaviour, tells me everything I need to know.

Couldn‚Äôt determine whether shouting was in fear or anger. Turned to see small distressed woman in light coloured jacket coming towards me. Checked around quickly to see if she was accompanied/being chased or ?? Bit concerned this was a mugging ploy. Woman confronts and berates me shouting that I was taking too long (amongst other things). In that moment I was completely confused as to what was going on. She went into the shop/till area. Seemingly she worked there. I went to the window to pay, as did another customer. The attendant refused cash; that was all I had. The other customer had had her pump turned off during filling so paid for just over ¬£1s worth of fuel. She was made to pay by card. Attendant continued to berate both of us, threatening to call the police. Tbh I would have welcomed that. This was all caused because the attendant had failed to close the station on time. Neither myself or the other customer knew that the station closed at 23:00 Bills settled, we left.
I returned on Tuesday to speak to the manager. He was concerned to learn that his staff member had caused a problem and that she wasn‚Äôt in uniform/hadn‚Äôt used tannoy to advise station was closing etc. Offered excuse that she was new and untrained. Asked me to return once he‚Äôd reviewed cctv. Returned Wednesday. He will need to speak with attendant, but could see issue in the recording. Please come back again. Called back today (Friday) Situation is becoming diluted by manager. Excuse for no uniform is because attendant was cold. Seemingly attendant now wants to apologise.

Shell Recharge Charging Station 923-931 Fulham Rd. London SW6 5HY,3.9,TK 421,2,"Living nearby is advantageous, but the area tends to be bustling, making it less ideal unless visited during off-peak times. The design is appealing when passing by in a vehicle, but lacks clear directional signage. The EV chargers are user-friendly, yet the charging cables are notably heavy due to their supercharging capabilities. The user interface (digit display info) is an improvement over other options, though not flawless. However, the cost is notably steep in comparison to Tesla, compounded by connection fees and surcharges that come across as a bit audacious. While the availability of facilities is a positive feature, regular usage could lead to spending a comparable amount as one would at a traditional petrol station, minus the wait time. It's worth mentioning that phone reception was often unavailable, necessitating the use of free WiFi, although this caused connectivity issues with the Tesla app. In essence, this serves as a starting point for EV infrastructure, though further advancements are needed for broader EV adoption.

He was on his own and she‚Äôd have to wait for her parcel as she wasn‚Äôt a petrol customer, even though she purchased other items. He was quick to take a payment for those items, but still made her wait  for yodel parcel.
When it was my turn to pay for my petrol I merely told him that he was being rude politely and it would be a better experience for all, to be more polite to customers. he told me if  I wasn‚Äôt happy, I could go elsewhere.  The lady also said that she usually gets her petrol from there but thought his behaviour was quite frankly rude and disgusting. Whether you are collecting a parcell, paying for petrol or buying items from the shop,  you‚Äôre still a customer, regardless. He kept moaning that he was on his own. She was very patient and even waited for such a long time. Then he had the audacity to be extremely rude to her and other customers, including myself.

Shell 134 West Hill London SW15 2UE,3.6,Richard Garey,1,"WARNING!!!  I am a resident of Putney who has patronized this Shell Station for years.  Typically, I only do a quick car wash and/or petrol fill up.  Last week, I washed my vehicle, then charged it and finally filled it with petrol.  The duration of the stay was 1 hour 42 minutes because that is how long it took to complete the above tasks.  Yesterday, I received a penalty charge of 100 GBP claiming that I ""parked"" at the facility too long.  With this violation were photos of my vehicle entering and leaving the facility. Note that this establishment has video surveillance throughout which would have recorded me servicing my vehicle.  All they have proven is that I was at their facility for 1 hour 42 minutes. To park implies one abandoned their vehicle and left the site.  If you read through the reviews below, you will see that other patrons have also been hit with a ""parking charge"".  This charge is ridiculous for numerous reasons.  First and foremost is that the Shell Service Station is in a residential area with plenty of street parking.  Why would anyone park there?  Second, they have vehicle chargers (which are extremely slow I must add) so it's very plausible that someone would stay on site for an extended period of time considering many patrons do use multiple services at the station.

UPDATE #1:  I filed an appeal with Euro  Car Park and received their response today.  They canceled the fine as a ""gesture of goodwill"". However, they also tried to explain why I was wrong and they were right including images of a sign that's not even current.  Given that their chargers are slow, good luck charging your vehicle in that time frame.  I have a plug-in hybrid and couldn't even get my small battery charged.  How would one even charge a full electric in that time frame?  You're better off just plugging into a streetlamp.  The whole thing is really mind-boggling to be honest.  Sending threatening letters to paying customers is no way to run a business.  My plan is to minimize my use of their facilities until such time that they rip down those signs and start operating a service station instead of London's most useless car park.

UPDATE #2: I have attached photos of Europark's signage which conveniently located behind an advertisement sign such that it easily goes unnoticed when you pull into the facility.  Note that the sign does not match the letter.",2024-06-15T10:40:28.535Z

As someone who works in the financial city and has lived here for many years I don‚Äôt expect to get judged negatively for coming into the shell garage carrying a motorbike helmet. I was about to pay for some supplies after a long ride and was questioned about my husband carrying a can of soft drink from another store. He basically accused him of drinking alcohol in the shell garage and kept pointing at some document on the wall. At first I wasn‚Äôt sure what he was saying as was just trying to buy some snacks. I have some advice for your training, if in fact you offer this to your staff. Firstly it‚Äôs my husband not my mate, secondly if you want to speak to him (another adult) ask him yourself don‚Äôt start having a go at a different adult (me) and thirdly ask some one politely don‚Äôt accuse them because at this point it was too late. I advise that you at least have the decency to talk to the person you‚Äôre directing the dialogue to, then establish politely what they drinking before making wrong and insulting accusations. It ruined our day, so I called when I got home to register my complaint, only to have other shell staff in the back ground saying ‚Äòyou pay before you open the drink‚Äô now intimating something else. We have so many lovely places to shop in Islington thankfully, and competitive petrol stations close by, so I won‚Äôt be going back to shell where the staff treat their customers like children.

Absolutely horrible service station. Do not ever use this service station to charge and/or wash your car. At least two of the charging points are broken at any time and you're charged an automatic ¬£45 deposit just to find out if the charging points are broken. The car wash is miserable with such short timeouts that you're better off washing your car at home with a bucket of soapy water and a sponge.

After my underwhelming exprience of having to wait for ages for a vacant wash bay [yes, one was broken and another driver cut in front of my car while I was in the loo], I found a parking penatly notice waiting for me on the doormat two weeks later.

Euro Car Parks and Motor Fuel Group are using that station as a scam and should be ashamed of themselves. Sure, you get your ¬£45 back after a few weeks but meanwhile they're earning interest on it. At the same time, Euro Car Parks is busily issuing parking fines to drivers who just happen to take longer than their meagre time slot allowance.

Located at select Shell petrol stations, this mini version of Waitrose offers a compact yet well-curated selection of high-quality products, making it a practical choice for quick shopping.

The combination of a petrol station with a Little Waitrose store allows customers to fuel their vehicles while grabbing groceries on the go. Inside, the store is designed for efficiency and convenience, offering a range of essentials like fresh sandwiches, snacks, drinks, and dairy items. For those in need of a quick meal, the store stocks ready-to-eat options such as salads and pre-packed meals, perfect for a busy day. In addition to food, you‚Äôll find toiletries, household items, and everyday essentials that make this spot ideal for quick refills.

Despite its small size, the store maintains Waitrose‚Äôs signature quality, with a focus on fresh, premium products. While the selection is limited compared to a full-size Waitrose supermarket, the items available are carefully chosen for convenience without sacrificing quality. The store also offers a variety of organic and high-end snacks, which sets it apart from typical gas station convenience shops.

The Shell pump facilities are also well-maintained, providing an easy and efficient refueling experience. The combination of quality petrol and groceries under one roof makes this location a time-saver for those looking to run errands while fueling up. Customer service is typically friendly and efficient, making the overall experience pleasant and streamlined.

In summary, the Little Waitrose at Shell with a Shell pump offers a quick, quality shopping experience that makes it an excellent stop for fuel and essentials on the go. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of convenience and quality for modern consumers.",2024-11-20T07:09:30.754Z

Today, I went to refuel at this establishment, and I was deeply humiliated. The manager refused to give me his name, and the cashier did the same, although I managed to see her initials (May). Both of them, two Indian individuals, treated me with extreme disrespect, falsely accusing me of trying to refuel and leave without paying. They claimed that someone in the driver‚Äôs seat was trying to escape. The person driving was my wife; I stepped out of the car to refuel. However, they refused to unlock the pump. I was forced to go inside and prepay to refuel my car‚Äîsimply because my car is old and because I am an immigrant.

This is an outrage, a blatant lack of respect! I am an honest worker, I fulfill my responsibilities, and I pay all my bills on time. I don‚Äôt need to endure this kind of baseless accusation. On top of that, the manager further humiliated me by accusing me of planning to leave without paying and making offensive remarks.

This incident happened today, November 22, 2024, around 8 PM. I will never return to this place, and I will make sure to warn my friends to avoid this establishment.

Shell Chertsey Rd Addlestone KT15 2ED,3.5,Growing your brand,1,"Good morning
I‚Äôd like to share a deeply unfortunate incident that happened to a friend of mine at this establishment. He was humiliated while trying to refuel his car. The manager refused to provide his name, as did the cashier, although her initials (May) were visible. Both of them, seemingly of Indian descent, treated my friend with extreme disrespect and falsely accused him of attempting to refuel and leave without paying.

Their claim was that someone in the driver‚Äôs seat was ‚Äútrying to escape.‚Äù In reality, it was his wife driving, while he stepped out of the car to refuel. Despite this, they refused to unlock the pump and forced him to go inside to prepay before refueling‚Äîsimply because his car is old and because he is an immigrant.

This is unacceptable! My friend is an honest, hardworking individual who fulfills his responsibilities and pays all his bills on time. He does not deserve to be treated this way. To make matters worse, the manager verbally humiliated him further, accusing him of planning to leave without paying and making several offensive remarks.

The incident took place on November 22, 2024, around 8 PM. After this experience, my friend has vowed never to return to this place and is sharing his story to warn others. He also plans to leave negative reviews about the establishment to expose the prejudiced and xenophobic behavior of these individuals.

Such actions are unacceptable, and it‚Äôs crucial to remember that everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, deserves to be treated with respect.",2024-11-23T09:12:38.003Z

Shell London Rd Virginia Water GU25 4QF,3.1,Jamie Hutchison,2,"SPOILER: ¬£100 parking charge for using SHELL garage as paying customer.

Came here to use the car wash facilities. Had to queue in the shop to get the voucher for cash wash. I asked if the vacuum took pound coins he said yes, so I asked for cash back, he said I would need to go to cash point.

I queued for the car wash, then had the car wash. Then queue again to get cash for vacuum. Vacuumed the car manually only to find it took cards anyway, no big deal. Carried on. Went back to shop for a drink. No big deal but stuck waiting for a another car to move for a minute or so. Left and thought no more about it.

FEW DAYS LATER ¬£100 CHARGE for parking whilst using SHELL services. Outrageous that a paying customer who is simply using the garage can be fined for using your services. SHELL please contact eurocarparks.com and have my charge for 12 August waived BMW GW55

When I approached the counter and greeted the staff with a ""Hi,"" the lady behind the counter didn‚Äôt even acknowledge me. Instead, she simply gestured for me to wait with her finger as she counted cash. I stood there patiently for a few more minutes while she finished her tasks, prioritizing everything else over serving a customer.

When she finally addressed me, I asked for a ""12-minute car wash."" She made me repeat myself multiple times, likely due to her limited English skills. After she handed me the receipt with the code for the jet washer, I tried to confirm where the code was located on the receipt. However, she completely ignored me again and didn‚Äôt even provide a proper sale receipt.

Overall, this was one of the worst customer service experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

UPD: After contacting Shell‚Äôs customer support, I spoke with Mateusz, who offered nothing beyond a generic apology. There was no gesture of goodwill or effort to resolve the issue. Most of his emails were simply copy-pasted responses from their manual, repeatedly stating that the station is operated by a retailer and not Shell directly.

I‚Äôve had nothing but bad experiences at this Shell station. The staff are rude, unhelpful, and act like they‚Äôre doing you a favor just by acknowledging you. Any time I‚Äôve asked about an issue, they‚Äôve been dismissive and condescending, treating me like I‚Äôm the problem instead of actually addressing the situation.

The EV charger has been out of order for at least two years, and every time I ask about it, I get the same useless response: ‚ÄúCome back next week.‚Äù Well, I‚Äôve tried three weeks in a row, and nothing has changed. Clearly, they have no intention of fixing it.

The air pump is also broken‚Äîit takes your money but doesn‚Äôt actually add pressure to your tires. The vacuum is useless, barely has any suction, and is a complete waste of time and money.

This place is a joke. If they can‚Äôt maintain their equipment or train their staff to be even remotely polite, they don‚Äôt deserve anyone‚Äôs business. I won‚Äôt be coming back.

Also noticed the very same behaviour from him with 3 other customers. Thankfully, he seems to have moved on to something else now. The petrol station and convenience store are generally clean but the car wash machine and air (for tyres) and water machine always seem to be out of service whether it's day or night.

I then escalated the issue to management, it took them 7 months to respond and they still refused to deal with it, actually told me to take it up with the manufacturer... Which is just buck-passing and pathetic! They totally didn't care that it was a dangerous product that they still continue to sell. Consumer rights states a product must be 'fit for purpose', a phone charger cable clearly should have a lifespan longer than 4 weeks, but none of this mattered to them. I was a regular customer here, and actually saved them a few times by reporting shoplifters in action... I wish i hadn't now! The management are ignorant, badly trained and don't know their consumer rights laws. This isn't about getting ¬£12 back, it's a matter of principal, public safety and poor customer care. They are a disgraceful, rotten, money-grabbing organisation with zero ethical values. They only care for profits no matter what the cost to others and Waitrose should have nothing to do with Shell.

I would like to report an incident I had with an employee at a Shell gas station. When I went to pay, I asked him if he could give me two pounds in 20p coins. He opened the register, looked at me, and said he wouldn‚Äôt give me the coins.

So, I immediately asked him to return my money and the biscuit I had taken. I had bought the biscuit so he could give me the change, but he refused, treated me very rudely, and told me never to come back to that petrol station.

I work in the area, and my company‚Äôs van and car frequently refuel at this station. I recorded a video of him saying that I should never return to the station. I believe he assumed I was homeless or something similar because he didn‚Äôt see me getting out of my car. I think that‚Äôs why he treated me so rudely and disrespectfully.

I have his name and the recording of the incident. When he noticed I was recording, he stopped talking, but shortly after, he told me again not to come back. There are also security camera recordings from the shopping center that will show I returned the product. However, he refused to refund my money, claiming he couldn‚Äôt process a refund and that I had to take the biscuit.

He was extremely rude and even threatened to call the police on me. I don‚Äôt understand why he would do that since I wasn‚Äôt stealing anything‚ÄîI just asked him for a small favor. His behavior was very disrespectful and unprofessional. It‚Äôs was 10 minutes ago.",2025-03-03T17:51:56.429Z
